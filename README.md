# Tomato Leaf Diseases Detection Using YOLOv8s

## Introduction
Tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and classification of these diseases are crucial for effective pest management and preventing large-scale losses. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advancements in deep learning, object detection models like **YOLOv8s** can provide an efficient and accurate solution for real-time disease identification.

In this project, we utilize **YOLOv8s**, a lightweight yet powerful deep learning model, to detect and classify diseases affecting tomato leaves. The model is trained on an annotated dataset containing images of healthy and diseased tomato leaves, enabling it to recognize various conditions with high precision.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from **[Tomato leaf disease detection in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf)**, which contains labeled images of different tomato leaf diseases, including:
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Leaf Mold
- Septoria Leaf Spot
- Healthy Leaves

This dataset is preprocessed and formatted according to the YOLO annotation format to ensure seamless integration with the YOLOv8s model.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop an efficient **real-time detection model** for identifying tomato leaf diseases.
- To **enhance agricultural monitoring** by providing an automated solution for early disease detection.
- To compare the performance of **YOLOv8s** with other deep learning-based classification models.

By implementing this model, we aim to assist farmers and researchers in detecting plant diseases at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention and improved crop protection.
